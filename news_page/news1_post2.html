        <h2>Second tribunal in the offing to unclog ICT backlog</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.daily-sun.com/public/news_images/2025/04/25/1745552437-50c2b3190ada5f8e06be179bb2890f08.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="400px">
        <p>The government has decided to establish a second tribunal to ease the burden on the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which is currently the only body hearing cases related to atrocities committed during the 2024 mass uprising and the fifteen-year Awami League administration. <br>
            ICT Chief Prosecutor Advocate Muhammad Tajul Islam announced on Thursday that the new tribunal will focus on crimes against humanity alleged to have occurred under Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic rule. <br>

            Speaking at a discussion organised by the Voice of Enforced Disappeared Persons (VOED) at the National Press Club in Dhaka, he explained that relying on a single tribunal to handle such a vast number of cases is simply impractical. <br>
            
            “Even the layperson would appreciate how overwhelming it is for one body to tackle allegations on this scale,” he said, adding that the second tribunal would be set up soon, and once operational, it would accelerate hearings and allow the prosecution team to expand. <br>
            
            Survivors of enforced disappearances who attended the VOED event called for the withdrawal of false charges, punishment for those responsible for disappearances, and justice for extrajudicial killings. <br>
            
            Responding to these demands, Advocate Tajul Islam noted that the prosecution team already consists of 17 prosecutors and is supported by 24 investigation officers, but acknowledged that more staff will be needed to manage the increased workload once the new tribunal is in place. <br>         
            
            To date, the ICT has registered 23 cases against 141 individuals and has received 339 allegations, of which 39 are under active investigation. Among the accused are civilians, police officers, and members of other security forces, with 54 arrests made so far and 87 suspects still at large. <br>
            
            Ousted fascist prime minister Sheikh Hasina faces charges in three separate cases. The tribunal has taken statements from over 1,000 witnesses and gathered more than 1,000 video clips as evidence. <br>
            
            Investigations into four high profile cases are nearing completion. Two inquiries – the killing of seven students during a protest in Chankharpul and the burning of six bodies in Ashulia – have been finalised. <br>
            
            The probe report on the Chankharpul incident has already been submitted to the ICT, and the prosecution team plans to file the formal charge sheet in that case in May. <br>
            
            Advocate Tajul Islam said that Tribunal ICT 1 is preparing to begin the full trial in the Chankharpul case as soon as possible.
